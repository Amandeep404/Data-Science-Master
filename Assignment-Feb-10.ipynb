    "### Q1 Which function is used to open a file? What are the different modes of opening a file? Explain each mode of file opening.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the `open()` function is used to open a file. This function takes two arguments: the name of the file to open, and the mode in which to open the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The different modes of opening a file are:\n",
    "\n",
    "`r` (read mode): This mode is used to read data from a file. The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file. If the file does not exist, an error is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "`w` (write mode): This mode is used to write data to a file. If the file exists, its contents are truncated. If the file does not exist, a new file is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "`a` (append mode): This mode is used to append data to the end of a file. If the file exists, the file pointer is placed at the end of the file. If the file does not exist, a new file is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "`x` (exclusive creation mode): This mode is used to create a new file. If the file already exists, an error is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "`b` (binary mode): This mode is used to open a file in binary mode. This is necessary when working with binary files, such as images or videos.\n",
    "\n",
    "`t` (text mode): This mode is used to open a file in text mode. This is the default mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "`+` (read/write mode): This mode is used to open a file for both reading and writing. The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file."

    "### Q2. Why close() function is used? Why is it important to close a file?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the `close()` method is used to close a file object that was previously opened using the open() method. It is important to close a file after it has been opened because:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Release of system resources: When a file is opened, the operating system allocates certain system resources, such as file descriptors, to the file. If the file is not closed properly, these system resources may not be released immediately, which can cause issues such as resource leaks, errors, and crashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Write buffering: If a file is opened in write mode, the close() method flushes any remaining data in the write buffer to the file before closing it. If the buffer is not flushed and the file is not closed properly, the data in the buffer may be lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "* File locking: If a file is opened in write mode, it may be locked by the operating system to prevent other processes from accessing it while it is being written to. If the file is not closed properly, the lock may not be released, which can cause issues such as file corruption or data loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, it is important to always close files after they have been opened and used.\n"
