    "**Ordinal Encoding vs. Label Encoding:**\n",
    "Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding are both techniques used in machine learning to convert categorical data into numerical format for model training. However, they are used in different scenarios and have distinct approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ordinal Encoding:**\n",
    "   - In ordinal encoding, categories are assigned numerical values based on their order or rank.\n",
    "   - It's suitable when the categorical variable has an inherent order or hierarchy.\n",
    "   - Example: Education levels (High School < Bachelor's < Master's < PhD) can be encoded as (1 < 2 < 3 < 4).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Label Encoding:**\n",
    "   - In label encoding, each category is assigned a unique integer label.\n",
    "   - It's used when there is no inherent order among categories.\n",
    "   - Example: Colors (Red, Blue, Green) can be encoded as (0, 1, 2).\n",

    "### Q2. Explain how Target Guided Ordinal Encoding works and provide an example of when you might use it in a machine learning project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer - \n",
    "\n",
    "**Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique used in machine learning to encode categorical variables based on their relationship with the target variable. It's particularly useful when dealing with categorical features that have a strong influence on the target variable.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how Target Guided Ordinal Encoding works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Calculate Target Mean/Median per Category:** For each category in the categorical feature, calculate the mean or median of the target variable for instances belonging to that category.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sort Categories:** Sort the categories based on their calculated means/medians. The category with the lowest mean/median gets the lowest label, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Assign Ordinal Labels:** Assign ordinal labels to the categories based on their order after sorting. The category with the highest mean/median gets the highest label, and the lowest mean/median gets the lowest label.\n",
    "\n",
    "This encoding technique takes advantage of the relationship between the categorical feature and the target variable. It's particularly useful when the categorical variable has a significant impact on the target and you want to capture that influence in the encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Scenario: Loan Approval Prediction**\n",
    "Suppose you're working on a machine learning project to predict whether a loan application should be approved or not. One of the features is \"Education Level,\" and you suspect that the education level might have an impact on loan approval. You can use Target Guided Ordinal Encoding in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Calculate Mean Approval Rate for Each Education Level:**\n",
    "   - High School: 0.40 (40% approval rate)\n",
    "   - Bachelor's: 0.60 (60% approval rate)\n",
    "   - Master's: 0.75 (75% approval rate)\n",
    "   - PhD: 0.85 (85% approval rate)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sort Education Levels Based on Approval Rates:**\n",
    "   - PhD (85%)\n",
    "   - Master's (75%)\n",
    "   - Bachelor's (60%)\n",
    "   - High School (40%)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Assign Ordinal Labels:**\n",
    "   - PhD: 4\n",
    "   - Master's: 3\n",
    "   - Bachelor's: 2\n",

    "\n",
    "**Covariance** is a statistical measure that quantifies the degree to which two random variables change together.

In other words, it measures the directional relationship between two variables. \n",
